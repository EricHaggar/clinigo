## Deliverable 1

The first deliverable concentrates on creating accounts and storing them into a database (Firebase).
Only one admin account exists but many patient and employee accounts can be created at will.
Each user has a first name, last name, email and password.

**Please Note: admin@admin.com is the sole admin email since Firebase authentication is used. Firebase requires an email to function.**
